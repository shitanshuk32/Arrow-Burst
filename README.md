## Overview

Canvas Circles with Arrows is a fun interactive web project built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It allows you to create circles with different colors on the left side of the canvas, and arrows on the right side. When you click inside a circle, the corresponding arrow starts moving towards the circle and bounces off when it hits the circle. The goal is to hit all the circles with the arrows.
